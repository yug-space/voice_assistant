A powerful voice assistant that uses Mistral AI for natural language processing, Whisper for speech recognition, and text-to-speech capabilities. The assistant can understand voice commands, search the web, and provide natural conversational responses.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è Voice activation with wake word detection ("Hey Mistral")
- üó£Ô∏è Natural speech recognition using Whisper
- ü§ñ AI-powered responses using Mistral
- üåê Web search integration for real-time information
- üîä High-quality text-to-speech synthesis
- ‚ö° Interrupt capability during responses
- üéØ Context-aware conversations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Mistral AI running locally (via Ollama)
- Audio input device (microphone)
- Audio output device (speakers)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd voice_assistant
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make sure you have Ollama installed and the Mistral model running locally:
```bash
ollama run mistral
```

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment if not already activated:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```
